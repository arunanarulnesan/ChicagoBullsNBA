Project name : 
Building the dream Chicago Bulls NBA team.

Description : 
As a data analyst for the Chicago Bulls, the task is to find the best starting five players (one from each position) for the upcoming NBA season while staying within the team's budget of $118 million for player contracts. The team's budget is ranked 26th out of 30 teams, which means that the team has limited financial resources compared to other teams in the league. Moreover, the team's performance in the previous season was not satisfactory, as they ranked 27th out of 30 teams based on win-loss record.

To complete this task, a thorough analysis of the players on the team and potential players from outside the team. The analysis took into account their performance in the previous season, their strengths and weaknesses, their fit within the team's playing style and their value for money. 

The repository contains a reproducible data analysis project and a generated knitr report using R Markdown. This report includes details of the analysis process, the selection criteria for the starting five players, and the performance metrics used to evaluate each player. Specific player recommendations for the team within the budget has also been provided.


Summary of analysis: 
For this project, I was given the task of selecting the best five starting players for the Chicago Bulls basketball team for the upcoming season while staying within a budget of USD 118 million for player contracts. I started by obtaining NBA player data for the past season and cleaning it up by removing unnecessary columns and missing values.

Using visualizations, I explored the data to gain insights into the relationships between different variables and player performance. I then performed a multiple linear regression analysis to create a model that could predict a player's score based a model that was built for a team on their performance statistics. Based on this model, I identified the players who were likely to score the highest and chose the best player for each position while considering their expected points, salaries and basketball background domian knowledge.

The following players were selected for the Chicago Bulls basketball team.
- Eric Bledsoe as the Point Guard
- Jimmy Butler as the Shooting Guard 
- Khris Middleton as the Small Forward 
- Pascal Siakam as the Power Forward
- Anthony Davis as the Center 

I am confident that these players will perform well on the court and help improve the team's ranking in the next season.
